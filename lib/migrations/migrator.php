/**
 * Migrations can manage the evolution of a schema used by several physical
 * databases. It's a solution to the common problem of adding a field to make a
 * new feature work in your local database, but being unsure of how to push that
 * change to other developers and to the production server. With migrations, you
 * can describe the transformations in self-contained classes that can be
 * checked into version control systems and executed against another database
 * that might be one, two, or five versions behind.
 *
 * General concept
 *
 * Migrations can be described as a triple {sequence of migrations,
 * current schema version, target schema version}. The migrations are "deltas"
 * which are employed to change the schema of your physical database. They even
 * know how to reverse that change. These behaviours are mapped to the methods
 * #up and #down of class Migration. A migration is a subclass of that class and
 * you define the behaviours by overriding methods #up and #down.
 * Broadly spoken the current schema version as well as the target schema
 * version are "pointers" into the sequence of migrations. When migrating the
 * sequence of migrations is traversed between current and target version.
 * If the target version is greater than the current version, the #up methods
 * of the migrations up to the target version's migration are called. If the
 * target version is lower, the #down methods are used.
 *
 * Irreversible transformations
 *
 * Some transformations are destructive in a manner that cannot be reversed.
 * Migrations of that kind should raise an Exception in their #down method.
 *
 * Example of use:
 *
 * Create a directory which will contain your migrations. In this directory
 * create simple php files each containing a single subclass of class Migration.
 * Name this file with the following convention in mind:
 *
 * (\d+)_([a-z_]+).php   // (index)_(name).php
 *
 * 001_my_first_migration.php
 * 002_another_migration.php
 * 003_and_one_last.php
 *
 * Those numbers are used to order your migrations. The first migration has
 * to be a 1 (but you can use leading 0). Every following migration has to be
 * the successor to the previous migration. No gaps are allowed. Just use
 * natural numbers starting with 1.
 *
 * When migrating those numbers are used to determine the migrations needed to
 * fulfill the target version.
 *
 * The current schema version must somehow be persisted using a subclass of
 * SchemaVersion.
 *
 * The name of the migration file is used to deduce the name of the subclass of
 * class Migration contained in the file. Underscores divide the name into words
 * and those words are then concatenated and camelcased.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Name                |   Class
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * my_first_migration  |  MyFirstMigration
 * another_migration   |  AnotherMigration
 * and_one_last        |  AndOneLast
 *
 * Those classes have to be subclasses of class Migration.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * class MyFirstMigration extends Migration {
 *
 *   function description() {
 *     # put your code here
 *     # return migration description
 *   }
 *
 *   function up() {
 *     # put your code here
 *     # create a table for example
 *   }
 *
 *   function down() {
 *     # put your code here
 *     # delete that table
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * After writing your migrations you can invoke the migrator as follows:
 *
 *   $path = '/path/to/my/migrations';
 *
 *   $verbose = TRUE;
 *
 *   # instantiate a schema version persistor
 *   # this one is file based and will use a file in /tmp
 *   $version = new FileSchemaVersion('/tmp');
 *
 *   $migrator = new Migrator($path, $version, $verbose);
 *
 *   # now migrate to target version
 *   $migrator->migrate_to(5);
 *
 * If you want to migrate to the highest migration, you can just use NULL as
 * parameter:
 *
 *   $migrator->migrate_to(NULL);
